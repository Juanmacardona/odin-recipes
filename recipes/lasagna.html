<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of wide pasta sheets, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, and melted cheese. It's a hearty and comforting meal that's often baked until golden and bubbling.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese (typically mozzarella and ricotta)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe, usually around 375°F (190°C).</li>
        
        <li>Prepare the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they're al dente. Drain them and set aside.</li>
        
        <li>Prepare the sauce: In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or sausage until browned. Add diced onions and garlic, then stir in tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and Italian seasoning. Let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Prepare the cheese mixture: In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, egg, and chopped parsley. Mix well.</li>
        
        <li>Assemble the lasagna: In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used up, finishing with a layer of sauce and mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        
        <li>Bake the lasagna: Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        
        <li>Let it rest: Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
