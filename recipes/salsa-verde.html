<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tomatillos</strong> These small, green, tomato-like fruits are the primary ingredient in salsa verde, providing a tangy flavor and vibrant green color.</li>
<li><strong>Jalapeños</strong> These green chili peppers add heat and depth of flavor to the salsa verde. They can be adjusted to taste depending on desired spice level.</li>
<li><strong>Cilantro</strong> Fresh cilantro leaves contribute a bright and herbaceous flavor to salsa verde, enhancing its freshness and complexity.</li>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Remove the husks from the tomatillos and rinse them under warm water to remove the sticky residue.</li>
    <li>Cut the tomatillos in half and place them cut side down on a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Broil the tomatillos in the oven until they are soft and slightly charred, about 5-7 minutes.</li>

    <li>Remove the stems from the peppers and place them in a blender or food processor.</li>
    <li>Add the roasted tomatillos, garlic, onion, cilantro, lime juice, and salt to the blender.</li>
    <li>Blend the ingredients until smooth, adding a little water if necessary to reach your desired consistency.</li>
    <li>Taste the salsa and adjust the seasoning as needed, adding more salt or lime juice if desired.</li>
